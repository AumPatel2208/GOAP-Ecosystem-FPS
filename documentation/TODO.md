# TODO

## PROJECT

- [x] ~~When talking about design patterns, mention how unity uses an Entity Component System.~~
  - [x] ~~Talk about how I refactored the creature class and created the BaseAIGoap to refactor the Debugging Log~~
- [x] ~~Talk about refactoring the AI system a little~~
  - <del>
    - As it currently stood, the AI will only execute a plan of actions if those actions fulfilled **all** the goal conditions
    - However this is not desirable as if there are no actions available, it is better to do something that will fulfil one goal over doing nothing. 
    - This will allow the actions to be more loosely coupled as in the first build, I had to have a series of actions 'connected' together through post-effects.
      - eg. Find food would not be executed if the creature was hungry and had not found food, so it would just go hungry; in the first build I also added an effect to findFood that was 'isHungry: false', which would fulfil the all 2 conditions 'foodTargetNull: false, isHungry: false', however the action find food does not directly fill the hunger of the creature so providing it with this effect is not truthful, therefore refactoring the system seems to be the best option over providing false effects to actions. 
      - This will make it so when the system gets more complicated than 2 goals and 2 actions, it will still be 'simple' to manage.
    - SOLUTION:
      - Detect when a plan fails whether the plan that was generated was a partial plan. If so, then multiply the cost for that by an arbitrary amount, in this case 10, and perform the action. </del>
- [x] Change all references to self to make them sound more formal, try to avoid the author however remove I
- [x] Food Chain explanation, write about bi-directional dictionaries.
  - Explain how I required the use of a dictionary where I could use the values as keys as well, and the simplest solution I found was to create two dictionaries. 
  - Later when writing the report, I found this article that explains that that data structure is called a bi-direction dictionary
    - https://erdiizgi.com/data-structures-for-games-bidirectional-dictionary-for-unity-in-c/
- [x] Explain the GOAP library properly
- [x] Expand upon Animator
  - How it is built into Unity 
- [x] intro explains what I was hoping to achieve.
- [x] Write about the changes from the PDD
- [ ] add intros to sections like Main Product.
- [ ] Larger images in the appendix as well
- [x] Player
  - [x] Player Movement, and mouse-look
    - [x] Add images
  - [x] Player Eat food
- [x] Remove Negative things about the project
- [x] Explain when adding the stamina, Sword does 50 damage but costs stamina, but ranged weapon does 10 damage without costing stamina, and you can fire from range, so there is that **trade-off**
- [x] Excess Hunger refills health
- [x] More about learning Unity
  - [x] Scenes
  - [x] Prefabs
  - [x] Importing Assets
  - [x] Attaching Components
  - [x] Mono Behaviours
- [ ] Change Figure Number references
- [x] Talk about (in GOAP AI) extracting items from the planning system to other systems, i.e. roaming, as this allows the roam to be interrupted.
  - Reference the GDC lecture '10 years of GOAP' 

## Appendix
- [x] Snapshot of git version history
- [ ] Tests
- [x] Installation document
  - [x] Mention the resolution at which the UI is placed perfectly.
- [ ] Known Bugs
  - [ ] Sword
  - [ ] Two Agents going for the same target may overlap each other as the pathfinding system will give them both the same path.

## Testing
1 day
  - [ ] creating use cases
  - [ ] verifying the use cases with evidence
- Player Controller
  - Player's gravity builds up when on objects that are not tagged as ground, not big issue and does not need refinement to the player controller
- Creature would lock onto one target and not change the target
  - Added a Randomly find new food component to the creatures that calls the perform method in the find food action, basically interrupting the planning system,
  - the change works enough to be functional
- Finding a target
  - Would find target normally
  - the creature would not find a target after it was already hungry
  - this lead to implementing partial goal completion.
- Partial Goal completion
  - Multiplier scale was too low at 3, so was upped to 10.
