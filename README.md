# Final year project

## Description

**Rain world** meets **Dark Souls** with mechanical inspiration from **Breath of the Wild**

- A first person game that is a mix between Rain World (by Videocult) and Dark Souls (by From Software).
- Includes an eco system like environment where the prey/predetors behave systemically where they interact with each other. The AI will either (as a simple example) hide if a prey or will hunt out their target if they are a predator, there will be dynamism within this system with many other possible states they could be in
    - for example a certain predator will only hunt when they are hungry, and others are more agressive and will kill regardless.
    - some enemies will use stealth tactics to either avoid the player and hunt down the player.
- The Dark souls aspect is reflected in the level design, I would like to have an interconnected level, where one checkpoint can be used multiple times using different shortcuts.
- I would also like to have a simple toolset that the player has, which is consumable and is crafted on the spot using collected resources. These are simple weapons to attack enemies with, or items to lure enemies out to clear a path, or lure two enemies to each other, causing them to fight amongst each other, letting the player pass by. These items could also be abilities like sensing enemies through walls, or hearing enemies that are sneakling up on you.
- as the enemy behaviour is pseudo-random, the players will always have to be careful when approaching areas.
- The players and enemies share the same health packs
    - So an enemy can pick it up as well to get health
    - Will be balanced by having a low chance of the enemy to go from attacking state to getting a health pack.

Some systems will be exapanded on and some of these will potentially be scrapped, however the core of the game is the enemies interacting with each other and the player being able to take advantage of it.

Keep everything simple so that interaction between systems is possible.



## Ideas

- Maybe have an outline effect on object that you are able to pick up
- Taming the mid-class predator enemies, only with certain items however
- 

## Resources

- Goal Oriented Action Planning.

  - Key Points:
    - Smart objects are objects that the AI can interact with.
  - Article should be enough to find a way to solve this
- Stealth game enemy detection Unity
