# Final year project

## Abstract
This project aim is to create a Souls-Like game with an AI system that allows for in-fighting between creatures based on a food chain. The AI system is at the core of this project and a version of Goal-Oriented Action Planning was used, where a planner creates branching action trees during gameplay and executes those actions leading to novel gameplay moments.

## Introduction
### Problem
The core focus of this project is around the AI system that is implemented to provide realistic interaction between creatures and the player, this most notably includes in-fighting between the different enemies based around a food chain. As well as this, this project also focuses on the different game systems that need to be implemented to get something that can keep the player engaged. This project was created using the Unity Game Engine, which is a very well documented, free to use 3D game engine to use with any genre of games; as this engine is fairly new to the author of this project, Unity specific topics will also be discussed to provide a more thorough overview on the implementation.

### Project Objectives
This project was broken down into two distinct parts, the minimum viable product, where the author is gaining his understanding of the AI system and Unity, and the Main Build, where more gameplay systems are added, the AI is more refined with more randomness to it, and the presentation is much more enhanced. These objectives were been updated since the PDD. 

### Minimum Viable Product
• 3 foods: a plant, a prey, and a predator
• Simple AI behaviour using Goal-Oriented Action Planning
• HUD elements for the Creatures stats 5
• Simple Unity Scene/Level to test the different features
• Sword Weapon with a combo system

### The Main Product
• Higher utilisation of the AI system
• Meshes and animations for the different creatures/food
• A Ranged Weapon for the player to attack with
• Hunger system with health regeneration
• Stamina usage and regeneration for the player
• Level restart on Player death
• Simple Level
• Heads Up Display to display the different player statistics
